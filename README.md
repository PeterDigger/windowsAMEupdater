# windowsAMEupdater

Knowing manually install Windows update can be time consuming. So, here's my solution towards tedious steps. 

The windowsAMEupdater required Administrator in order to run the script. 

Good luck and have fun!


This is my small act of kindness towards the community in Windows AME project. Hope this helps!

This script is for those wanted to perform the windows update without memories the command itself.

Features:
1. Able to check installed update
2. Extract .msu to .cab 
3. Install update
