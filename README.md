# windowsAMEupdater

Congrats to those who has already installed the Windows Ameliorated!

I have been using the Windows Ameliorated for over 3 months. I would say that Windows Ameliorated is an awesome project to someone doesn't those "bloat" in their Windows 10 operating system. (Reason why I installed this, is because I got mad at the Windows Update that forced reboot when I'm in the middle of the critial mission.) 

Installing the cummulative updates can take up to 30 minutes for the whole process(That's what I experiencing now) So, knowing manually install Windows Update can be time consuming. Whenever I wanted to install the Windows Update, I need to refer back the installation commands. So, here's my solution towards those "tedious" steps.
